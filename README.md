## 🧑🤖 Entities 🕹️

- **Players**: You and your opponent!
- **Game Board**: The 3x3 grid where you'll make your moves.
- **Markers**: Choose between "0" and "X" to represent yourself on the board.
- **Categories**: Every position on the board is associated with a random category.
- **Questions**: Get ready to answer questions related to the chosen category!
- **Scorecard**: Keep track of who's winning and how many games have been played.
- **Winner**: The player who gets three markers in a row wins the game! 🏆

## 🎲 How to Play 🎲

1. Start the game, and the board will be initialized with random categories.

2. Take turns with your opponent to choose a marker position on the board. The player who starts can pick their favorite marker - "0" or "X".

3. After selecting a position, a question related to the category will be revealed.

4. Answer the question correctly to place your marker. If you get it wrong, your opponent's marker takes the spot.

5. Keep playing until one of you gets three markers in a row - vertically, horizontally, or diagonally! That player is declared the **Winner**. 🥇

6. Power Modes: Use special abilities to your advantage:
   - 💡 **Change the Question**: Don't like the question? Use this power mode to get a new one!
   - 🕵️ **Show Hint**: Stuck on a question? Reveal a hint to help you out.
